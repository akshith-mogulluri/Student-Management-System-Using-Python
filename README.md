# StudentManagementSystemUsingPython
##By: Akshith Mogulluri

This program is to build a simple Student Management System by using python which can perform the following:

1.) Add New Student

2.) View Students

3.) Search Student

4.) Update Student

5.) Delete Student

6.) Quit

At first we create a csv file by running the code and adding the student details or by uploading a csv file with student details (i.e, Roll Number, Name, Age, Email and Phone number) into the path where this python file is located.

Then we can select any option provided fields to perform the requested actions.

The code is based on user-defined function concept where the code call the required pre-defined function when ever the programmer calls for it.
